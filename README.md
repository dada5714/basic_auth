#Basic Auth
This is a basic authentication system built using Railscast #250 (Authentication From Scratch). It provides a client with a simple signup, login, and logout interface that they can apply to any Rails App.

To demonstrate authorization, the index page cannot be viewed unless the user is signed in.
